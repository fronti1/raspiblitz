# Shopping List: Switzerland

*__NOTICE: This shopping list had just basic testing of components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 240 CHF)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspberryPi 4 2GB: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb)
* ShimFan Cooling: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/fan-shim-for-raspberry-pi) (order later if sold out)
* Power USBC: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/raspberry-pi-15w-power-supply-eu-schwarz)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/rainbow-pibow-coupe-4-raspberry-pi-4-only)
* 500GB SSD: [Digitec](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/crucial-mx500-500gb-25-ssd-7331523)
* SSD-Case: [Digitec](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/icy-box-ib-ac703-u3-converters-6067574)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/32gb-microsd-karte-class10-noobs-fuer-raspberry-pi-bereits-installiert)
* LCD-Display: Original Display is not available in CH. You can by the original from [Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B06X191RX7) or us this [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/3-5inch-rpi-lcd-b-ic-test-board). If display from pi-shop.ch, you have to install the drivers manually.

## Package: Minimal (around 200 CHF)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [Digitec](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/toshiba-canvio-basics-1tb-externe-festplatte-3227990)
